Version: 0.4.4 WIP
Date: 16.12.2025
  Features:
    - Picker Dollies support (teleporters and all of it's components are blacklisted).
    - Teleporters now default to building on the 2x2 rail grid for easier train alignment.  Can be turned off in the start up settings.  Turning this off does not effect the blueprint restriction, it just makes it so you otherwise cannot build teleporters off the rail grid.
    - Teleporters will now pipette properly, the output port does NOT to avoid blueprint confusion and extra items being brought to the wrong entity.
    - More micro-optimizations to claw back UPS in megabases with hundreds of teleporters.
  Bugfixes:
    - Crash when mouse-over an existing teleporter with a teleporter ghost in hand.
    - Placement collision between teleporters is fixed, now you cannot place a teleporter that would overlap another one; any attempt will fail and the item will be refunded to the player or spilled on the ground (robot/script placement).
    - Fixed up event filters to only trigger on the intended entities.
    - Some items that shouldn't show up in menus and items that should that didn't.
    - Blueprint teleporter output port now has an icon.
    - Blueprint teleporter name parameter now has an icon.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.3
Date: 16.12.2025
  Features:
    - Added a basic "Tips and tricks" section.
  Bugfixes:
    - Factoriopedia now displays ring platform animation correctly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.2
Date: 16.12.2025
  Features:
    - Added "Basic/Advanced" Manual Dialing UI toggle, UI will open in "basic" mode until toggled into "advanced", setting is remembered per-player.
    - Teleporter now supports quality - enjoy higher capacity storage in the accumulator and higher health of the teleporter before the biters eat it.
  Bugfixes:
    - Crash on blueprinting tiles only (no entities).
    - Internal table of entities protected from damage on collision with the teleportation barrier included obsolete entities instead of the new versions.
    - Fixed the icon on the protected (shield) status in the Manual Dialing UI - now on larger UI scales the drop-down becomes wide enough to show the icon and full text.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.1
Date: 15.12.2025
  Bugfixes:
    - Uses nil check for blueprints.
    - Now displays Space Age as a dependency.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.0
Date: 14.12.2025
  Features:
    - Overhauled Manual Dialing UI for advanced users managing large teleporter networks:
      - Separates ring-id from location;
      - New columns to show teleporter signals: ring-id, goto-id, timer and, protection status (shield);
      - Added filtering options for location (surface), ring-id, goto-id, protected status, nicknames (including supporting icons) and, force;
      - Header, filter and, viewing teleporter always stay at the top of the UI window when scrolling;
      - Selected teleporter is in the header and never filtered out;
      - Sending/Receiving/Low power/Waiting status shown in teleport button.
    - Custom status area of the teleporter (the mouse-over sidebar) will now show:
      - LED status (see changes below);
      - Protection status: circle = open, shield = protected;
      - Teleporter nickname;
      - Teleporter signals: ring-id, goto-id and, wait timer (and remaining timeout).
    - Added "teleporter ring output" to get feedback from the teleporter, jam wires into the front grill of the display and read:
      - LED status (1=green, 2=yellow, 3=red);
      - Low power (1 = low power);
      - Occupied status (0 = unoccupied, 1 = sending, -1 = recieving);
      - Waiting (timeout remaining in seconds);
      - Custom status shows same LED status, protection and, name as the display;
      - Recorded in blueprints so wiring is maintained;
      - Will open the manual dialing for the teleporter when clicked on.
      - Placement item now has graphics and collision.
    - A fake train stop is created for the teleporter:
      - Shows the teleporter name on the map with the teleporter icon prefixed to it's nickname;
      - This is also the base graphic entity of the teleporter (effects blueprinting, see Known "Features" below);
      - Clicking on the stop on the map will open the Manual Dialing UI for the teleporter;
      - Gives the teleporter parameterized blueprint support for it's nickname (see below).
    - Full blueprint support:
     - Through the fake train stop, the teleporter nickname is saved in the blueprint and applied on placement and is fully parameterized;
     - Teleporter output port is properly blueprinted so complete wiring of your design isn't an issue.
  Changes:
    - Status LED (both in custom status and manual dialing UI) - green = ready, yellow = not ready (sending/receiving/waiting), red = low charge.
    - "Charge Level" in manual dialing UI now shows the actual accumulator charge level - exactly the same as you see in the mouse-over sidebar information.
    - Teleportation animations from "simple-entity-with-force" to "animation" using frame offsets, meaning, teleportations can happen as soon decided instead of waiting for key framing every 5th second (multiples of 300 game ticks) - This means instantly for manual dialing and no more than 30 ticks for circuit control.
    - Teleporters will no longer "remember" signals and try to teleport when power is charged enough.  Now, if there isn't enough power and a teleport is signaled, it will just be ignored.  This is to make the teleporters behave in a manner consistent with vanilla entities as well as allow for circuit logic to cancel the request (by setting the value to 0).
    - Input circuit signals are combined between red and green wires instead of returning the red or green value (in that order), to behave consistently with vanilla end-point entities that use the combined values (assemblers, train stops, etc).
    - Major code overhaul to optimize and smooth out gameplay to prevent jitters caused by bulk batch processing.
  Bugfixes:
    - There is now proper visual representation of the teleporter when placing and in blueprints, you will need to place your old blueprints and remake them for this change to take effect.
  Known "Features":
    - Blueprinted teleporters with the "name parameter" (fake train stop) have a couple caveats:
      - First, the blueprint will be restricted to placement on the 2x2 rail grid;
      - Second, removing it from the blueprint means there will be no teleporter sprite in the blueprint and the teleporter will be given a random backer name on placement, and the teleporters blueprinted [parameterized] nickname will be lost;
      - Note: Neither of these "features" will effect the function of the teleporter or circuit wiring of the blueprint;
      - Bear these details in mind when designing blueprints.
  Known Bugs:
    - Placement item does not show power connection.

Version: 0.3.0
Date: 18.02.2025
  Features:
    - Automatic timer mode. Given timer signal, the goto signal will no longer trigger teleportation. Instead it will wait for the timer amount, teleport to goto signal and then the loop starts again. If scheduled timer teleport is missed (no power for example), then it will teleport as soon as possible. Minimum time step is 5 seconds.
